## Overview

### Screenshot

![](images/result.JPG)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Completing this challenge showed me that it is not complicated to style a webpage using boxes. The most 'difficult' part of this challenge was adding the margin to the main container, and making it look as similar as possible to the original one. Additionally, I added a box shadow to it, which I consider, it's a good detail and makes the design look better.

I used the font-family: 'Rubik', sans-serif; And this colors for the fonts and the background colors:

#e4f1fe
#9ba6a5
#73b1c1
#a7bcb9
#fffdfb


```css
.container-row {
  width: 25%;
  margin: 100px auto;
  background-color: #fffdfb;
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 5px 10px 20px #9ba6a5;
}
```
